The point is to help browsing large amounts of announcements by showing many of them on one screen.

## Backend 
server.js nodejs express server makes http request to tori.fi
parse.js to convert DOM elements into json

Notice! The layout changes often, perhaps weekly, sometimes daily.

## Frontend

just a vue draft with some mock/test data,
and a query for Pirkanmaa region
when page is scrolled to end, more data is loaded
